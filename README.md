## Install

To install it, run `npm install` and `bower install`.

## Develop

Run `gulp` to develop your app.

## Build

When your app is ready for deployment, run `gulp build` and all the built files will be created under the `docs` folder.

## Content / View / Controller

All the content is written in YML in the src/content/ directory. Gulp will compile into json files. These json files will be called by the corresponding Vue components to render it in the view.
